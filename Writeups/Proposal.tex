% discipline, variables of interest, research question,
We propose to explore the relationship between measures of urbanization -- such as urbanization levels (i.e., the percentage of urban population over total population) and urban primacy (i.e., the percentage of the biggest city's population over the total urban population) -- and other economic indicators, such as 
literacy rates, 
health indices (prevalence of HIV), 
infant mortality, 
labor participation,
crime rates,
poverty rates, etc.

We plan on using data from \url{http://data.worldbank.org/topic/urban-development}, which have been gathered from the UN Population Division, WHO, International Road Federation, World Resources Institute, and other sources.\footnote{More indicators available at \url{http://data.worldbank.org/indicator}.}

The data are longitudinal, collected over several years across many different countries. Due to the scope of this project and potential problems such as autocorrelation, we intend to choose one or two key years and explore relationships amongst our cases/countries.
